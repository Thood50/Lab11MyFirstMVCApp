# Lab11MyFirstMVCApp

## Summary:  
This application allows the user to put in two dates and returns the people of the year who are between the two years.
To get a result, type in a 4 digit year in the input field after the start year and also after the end year.  
Once there are numbers for both fields, press the button named "Send Data" and it will redirect you to a results page.  
This results page will have a table containing all the people of the year between the inputted start year and end year.
